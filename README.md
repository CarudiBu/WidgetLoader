# WidgetLoader
Put homescreen widgets on the Z Flip3 cover screen. This app is not ready for any use yet and is in early stages of development and may never be released. If you want a proof of concept of this whole idea, see [SubUI-example](https://github.com/CarudiBu/SubUI-example). You cannot have Samsung Health installed at the same time as WidgetLoader.

## Usage
Install the app, then open cover screen settings and add 'WidgetLoader'. You're now ready to add a widget.

Open WidgetLoader and choose a widget, and configure it. Now close the phone and look at the cover display. If the widget appears and follows the settings you have 
configured, you're good to go. If WidgetLoader appears in the widget list, but says 'Loading' instead of showing the widget you have chosen, uninstall and reinstall 
WidgetLoader. If WidgetLoader doesn't appear at all, reboot your phone.
